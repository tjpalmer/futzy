I had trouble finding a simple Python client library for the RoboCup Soccer
Server (rcss), so here's one.

The goal here is to be very simple. I probably need some kind of world model to
maintain state from server updates, but the main idea is to keep things as bare
as possible so that other tools can do what they want to with it.

Actually, I'm moving toward a ROS bridge at the moment.
